# Matplotlib---Module-5-Challenge
 Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of your notebook.
1) From the selected treatments Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of tumors better.
2) The Mouse weight also determined how big the tumor is and how the medicine effected it.
3) Tumor volume (mm3) decreased over time (based on timepoint) for mice involved in the Capomulin study on average

I worked with a peers on this assignment for support, had help from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, and use ASKbcs
